== Introduction ==

All XML data stored in XBird is organized into a hierarchy of _collections_. 

A collection is exactly what its name suggests: it contains any number of XML documents, and can in addition contain its own child collections, thus providing a hierarchy. 
_A collection is directly mapped into a directory_ of the underlying file system. 

The "root" collection is also called the Database. It is special in that:
  * It has no parent as the name tells.
  * The database root directory is specified through _xbird.database.datadir_ property in [http://code.google.com/p/xbird/source/browse/trunk/xbird-open/main/conf/xbird/config/xbird.properties xbird.properties]. By the default, `java.io.tmpdir'/xbird is used for the directory. 

== Configuring a Database ==

The _xbird.database.datadir_ property can be overrided by putting your modified  _xbird.properties_ file on the directory where System.getProperty("user.dir") directs.

{{{
// You can simply ask the system for the “java.io.tmpdir” and "user.dir" properties as following:
String tmpDir = System.getProperty("java.io.tmpdir");
String userDir = System.getProperty("user.dir");
System.out.println("java.io.tmpdir: [" + tmpDir + "], user.dir: [" + userDir + "]");
}}}
