#labels Phase-Implementation,Featured

== Introduction ==

The XBird engine has the following three facilities: (file) XQuery query processor, client/server XML native database and embedded XML database. 

This document introduces a way to run the XML database server and lectures how to access the database in client/server fashion. XBird uses RMI as the internal protocol of remote access, and hence, the embedded access achieved in the same way.
