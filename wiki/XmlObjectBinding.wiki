#summary XML/Object Binding and Object Persistence: XStream + XBird= !

= Introduction =

XBird introduces an object persistence feature using XStream. 
It supports querying capabilities to persistence objects with the full XQuery expressibility.

The feature uses [http://xstream.codehaus.org/persistence-tutorial.html XStream persistence API] to serialize a Java object into XML instead of a binary format, and then use a native XML database, i.e., XBird, to persist the objects.ã€€
It is easy since XStream avoids tedious configuration through [http://xstream.codehaus.org/annotations-tutorial.html annotation] or [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_over_Configuration Convention Over Configuration].
