#summary XML/Object Binding and Object Persistence: XStream + XBird= !
#labels Phase-Implementation

= Introduction =

XBird introduces an object persistence feature using XStream. 
It supports querying capabilities to persistence objects with the full XQuery expressibility.

The feature uses XStream to serialize a Java object into XML instead of a binary format, and then use a native XML database, i.e., XBird, to persist the objects.
