#summary Creating Collections and importing Documents
#labels Phase-Design,Phase-Implementation

== Introduction ==

All XML data stored in XBird is organized into a hierarchy of _collections_. 

A collection is exactly what its name suggests: it contains any number of XML documents, and can in addition contain its own child collections, thus providing a hierarchy. 
_A collection is directly mapped into a directory_ of the underlying file system. 

The "root" collection is also called the Database. It is special in that:
  * It has no parent as the name tells.
  * The database root directory is specified through _xbird.database.datadir_ property in [http://code.google.com/p/xbird/source/browse/trunk/xbird-open/main/conf/xbird/config/xbird.properties xbird.properties]. By the default, `java.io.tmpdir'/xbird is used for the directory.

You can simply ask the system for the “java.io.tmpdir” property as following:
{{{
String tmpDir = System.getProperty("java.io.tmpdir");
System.out.println("java.io.tmpdir: [" + tmpDir + "]");
}}}
