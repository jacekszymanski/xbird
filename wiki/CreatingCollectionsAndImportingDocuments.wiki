#summary Creating Collections and importing Documents
#labels Phase-Design,Phase-Implementation

== Introduction ==

All XML data stored in XBird is organized into a hierarchy of _collections_. 

A collection is exactly what its name suggests: it contains any number of XML documents, and can in addition contain its own child collections, thus providing a hierarchy. 
*A collection is directly mapped into a directory* of the underlying file system. 

The "root" collection is also called the Database:
  * It has no parent as the name tells.
